title: "Studio d'essai cvi â€“ Purge 1: The Residents"
---

Freeing some space on my hard drive. I do not want any The Residents to come up in random shuffle explorations of my music library, so here's a selection from the seven releases I have before they get purged.

Enjoy! I hope you do, because it was rather painful to listen to them so much in order to pick the alright ones...
