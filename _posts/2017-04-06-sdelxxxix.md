title: "Studio d'essai lxxxix – francophonie expérimentale #3"
---

We keep exploring "experimental" music from the francophonie.

Today, we are still stuck in the seventies, with two exceptions to open and close the show: a stretch back to 1931 and a jump forward to 2015.

Next time, we should mostly have music from the current decade to close this series.
