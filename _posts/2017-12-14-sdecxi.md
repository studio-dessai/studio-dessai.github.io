This week, Damian prepared a playlist of ambient, IDM and more, and talks about his experience running an online streaming radio between 2003 and 2007: Systrum Sistum. There is also a bit of a discussion about how music distribution on the Internet evolved in the last two decades.

Thank you for joining us and sharing some of your favourites, Damian!
