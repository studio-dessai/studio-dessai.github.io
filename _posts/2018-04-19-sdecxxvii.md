This week's show is all over the place â€“ as if that's not the usual format. A sandwich of nice and cosy buns with a noisy harshy spicy patty. General vibe: soft, smiley and content.

Shout out to the [Fediverse](https://fediverse.party/), which is currently welcoming quite a few folks, and which brought us one of tonight's show's tracks. If you started following us on Mastodon or Diaspora in the last week, you might have gotten a shout out on air, lucky lucky!

If you're cycling around your part of the world (good on you!), make sure you keep an eye out and stay safe. You never know, and even well-meaning drivers have the odd off day.
