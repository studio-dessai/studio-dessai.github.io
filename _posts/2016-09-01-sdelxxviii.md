title: "Studio d'essai lxxviii – Netlabel Day 2016 #4"
---

Fourth episode playing Stéphane's favourite tracks from this year's Netlabel Day edition. Enjoy those!

The last track by PierPablo definitely used some [Burial](http://musicbrainz.org/artist/9ddce51c-2b75-4b3e-ac8c-1db09e7c89c6) and [Asa Chang & Junray](http://musicbrainz.org/artist/ad7f6f52-e243-4bd0-b077-a7f08dc66d06) (not played on air, follow the link below to get the whole track). Can you ID more material? If so, please let us know!

Sorry, Chris Newman, for mispronouncing "Delicate Apparatus": there was a typo in the compilation's PDF notes.
