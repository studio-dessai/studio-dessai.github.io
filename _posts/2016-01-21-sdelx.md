title: "Studio d'essai lx â€“ David Bowie"
---

Meg, Dave and Tim joined Steph to play their favourite Bowie songs. Skip to 2:33 to get to the start of the show.

Meg read a part of Tilda Swinton's speech, which is available in full [here](http://www.vulture.com/2013/03/read-tilda-swintons-speech-about-david-bowie.html).

To conclude, here is a quote by Jacob Applebaum that Steph liked:

> Bowie leaves us and then a 9th planet appears, I don't need to read your science article.
