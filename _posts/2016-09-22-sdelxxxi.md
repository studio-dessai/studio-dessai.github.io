I keep getting things wrong... Let's make things clear: Brian Eno is from England; Nomenclatures is the artist and *Empathy* is the name of the track; Global Digital is the name of the radio I volunteer at; none of the Aesu tracks are available anymore... Geeeeee.

Make sure you check out Mikael Groc AKA Emile Miroir Jr's visual art on [his website](http://www.mikaelgroc.com/).
