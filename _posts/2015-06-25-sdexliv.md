title: "Studio d'essai xliv – with Matt Redlich"
---

[Matt Redlich](https://mattredlich.bandcamp.com/) – telented Brisbane producer, member of [Holy Holy](http://musicbrainz.org/artist/e0bbec7a-7a81-466f-ba0f-08240dd4980e) – joined Steph to play some his favourite tracks from the last 60 years. Some of them are from artists who inspired him a while ago, others are tracks he just discovered the other day and really made an impression...

Steph got something wrong though: [Souls of Mischief](http://musicbrainz.org/artist/7b61cf8f-c042-4bd4-b64a-25cb40f3dd50) – who sampled Billy Cobham's _Heather_ on _93 Still_ – were actually [remixed](https://gummysoul.bandcamp.com/album/93-still-gummy-soul-remix) by [Wally Clark](http://musicbrainz.org/artist/21acb306-ceed-487f-993b-f37b9c67bac2); however, his Gummy Soul colleague [Amerigo Gazaway](http://musicbrainz.org/artist/7740488b-2d31-422b-8764-1b39ba4e0f08) [remixed](https://amerigo.bandcamp.com/album/bizarre-tribe-access-denied-3) [A Tribe Called Quest](http://musicbrainz.org/artist/9689aa5a-4471-4fb4-9721-07cecda0fa9f), who sampled George Duke's _North Beach_ on _Midnight Marauders_ the same year as Souls of Mischief! I know, right?

Thanks to Matt for this great selection! Looking forward to another one.
