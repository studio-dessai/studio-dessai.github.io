title: "Studio d'essai xxxiii – the Internet Archive"
---

Stéphane shares his selection from the Internet Archive. A lot of noise today! I realised after the show that the first two band actually share a member: [Mikhail Lezin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system), very prolific on the Internet Archive.

If you are interested in learning more about the L-systems Zhang Li uses to create her music, head to the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) on the subject.

You can download all the releases we had a taste of from the links in the playlist. Make sure you check out Tom Fahy's [Auralnaut](http://auralnaut.com/)'s (+ Stag Record) and the Taiwanese [Kandala Records](http://www.kandalarecords.tw/)' label websites for more fascinating material.

Enjoy!
