title: "Studio d'essai lxix"

Some older (1969) and newer (2016) music for this episode, and some more in between, from both sides of the Atlantic ocean.

Excuse the messiness! You can skip the first minute of the recording (or more if Steph's rambling intro is not to your liking).

Pronunciation note for later: /ˈtʃɛ**k** rᵻˈpʌblɪk/
