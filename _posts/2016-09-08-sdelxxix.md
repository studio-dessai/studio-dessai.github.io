title: "Studio d'essai lxxix – Netlabel Day 2016 #5"
---

Fifth and final episode playing Stéphane's favourite tracks from this year's Netlabel Day edition. This week's episode features only three tracks, but they manage to represent some of our favourite genres: ambient, IDM, experimental and techno.

We played a total of thirty-two tracks during those last five episodes, but stay tuned for a mix of even more music from Netlabel Day 2016!
