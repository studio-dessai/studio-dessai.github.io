The mix I plundered is by Takenae, using songs from the 1983 cassette _[Serge Musician Tape](http://musicbrainz.org/release/f8c04fa1-407e-4014-9837-fd087422fe97)_ for the most part.

The Nick R 61 track is from [one](http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Miquel_Parera/nx2016-02) of the many CC electronic music compilations Miquel Parera kindly put together.

_Erratum_: The final Aeons track is not from Netlabel Day 2014, as the event had its first edition in 2015.
