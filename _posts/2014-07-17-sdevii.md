This week, we had Tim as our new guest. He shared with us a few tunes and we are looking forward to having him again on the show!

Lochlan's ghost also made an appearance.
	
Here is a quote from Mykki Blanco that we did not get to read on air but wanted to share:

>“Will hip hop ever accept me? Who gives a fuck. Will the gay community turn their back on me if I stop dressing in drag? Who gives a fuck. Will I get signed? Who gives a fuck. I did a world tour off the strength of Soundcloud singles, a lo-fi mixtape and my first EP. I was out there, I saw the power of music and saw the power of love and now I just want to develop my music and have fun. People who fuck with Mykki Blanco fuck with Mykki Blanco, no image or politics needed. Light a blunt with your friends and listen to my new track Booty Bamboo. I feel free, I hope you do to.”
