title: "Studio d'essai lxxxvii – francophonie expérimentale #1"
---

We start an exploration of "experimental" music in the francophonie. Stay tuned for more music from different French-speaking countries as we wander more or less chronologically over a few episodes.

Today, a few artists that were involved with the Groupe de Recherche Musicale at some stage in their career, a couple of epic composers, and a taste of what will likely be the sub-theme of the next episode: the seventies.

_Please ignore the first 70 seconds, I completely forgot to go on air..._
