Discover artists you possibly never heard of, from three sources: a compilation from the radical collective [Unfamous Resistenza](http://blog.unfamousresistenza.fr/), another compilation of some of the best of 2015 according to the veteran website [trip-hop.net](http://trip-hop.net/), and the amazing eclectic [Vaatican Records](http://gestrococlub.org/tympans.htm) catalogue.

Four, two and three, make seventy.

Check out Mathieu Desjardin a.k.a Longamagam's [wacky artwork](https://www.flickr.com/photos/longamagam/), it really is worth it!
