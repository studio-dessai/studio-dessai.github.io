Another week, another bunch of songs that you might like. Fairly easy listening this week, with some classics I had never played on the show before, for some reason.

The three last tracks were from Netlabel Day 2015. You can find all the releases from that edition on [this website](http://netlabelday.blogspot.com.au/p/releases-2015.html).

Enjoy!
