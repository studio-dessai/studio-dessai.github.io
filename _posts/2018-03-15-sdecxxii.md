title: "Studio d'essai cxxii â€“ Netlabel Day 2017 #5: Into the Rift"
---

This fifth episode in the NLD2017 series is dedicated to [Cerebral Audio](https://musicbrainz.org/label/41466a23-3b62-47b4-a627-25f33d23f826)'s compilation _[Into the Rift Volume 2: World Wide Storms](https://musicbrainz.org/release/4c814e18-8a50-43bb-be2e-78c3270a6a49)_.

I use the name "Cerebral Rift" throughout the show, but the netlabel recently changed their name to "Cerebral Audio".

You can go to Cerebral Audio's [website](https://cerebral.audio/product/into-the-rift-volume-two-world-wide-storms/) to download the whole compilation and support their work.

Have a fabulous week!
