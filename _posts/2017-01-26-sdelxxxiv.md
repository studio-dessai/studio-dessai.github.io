Finally back! Sorry about the lengthy break.

Pierre-Yves joined St√©phane for this first show of the year, and selected most of the tracks. You might remember his first contribution to the show: the excellent mix he put together under the moniker Joey 808, which you can still listen to on [this page](https://studio-dessai.github.io/2015/06/18/sdexliii/).

Thank you Pierre-Yves for your visit to Australia, and for coming along to the studio!

You can find Underjack's ambient techno on [Annulled's Bandcamp page](https://annulledmusic.bandcamp.com/album/entering-transistor-bay-cd).
