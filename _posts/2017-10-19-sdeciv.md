Six (and a half) diverse artists, from six different places.

Thanks [bartira@mastodon.art](https://mastodon.art/@bartira) for sharing on Mastodon and the Internet Archive; and thanks [Nachtst√ºck Records](https://nachtstuckrecords.bandcamp.com) for giving away your earnings.

Bartira let me know that POC means "People of Colour". On more TLA to remember!

Be good! Call you mum!
