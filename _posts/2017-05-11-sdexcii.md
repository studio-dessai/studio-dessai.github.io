title: "Studio d'essai xcii – Jean-Jacques Perrey"
---

As promised ages ago,  this is a special on Jean-Jacques Perrey, who passed last year.

(Re)-read Wally's tribute to him [here](http://thelogjournal.com/2016/11/21/coming-soon-gotyes-tribute-to-jean-jacques-perrey/), and watch [this great doco](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNNb06zJHjs) about him (in French).

Coincidentally, as I write this, I got [an email](http://mailchi.mp/gotye/old-music-and-a-new-record-label?e=e561455811) from Wally's newsletter, letting me know about a brand new release, available digital and on vinyl: _[Jean-Jacques Perrey et son Ondioline](https://jean-jacquesperrey.bandcamp.com/album/jean-jacques-perrey-et-son-ondioline)_. It is a compilation of 33 tracks, that Wally curated for his new label: [Forgotten Futures](https://forgottenfutures.bandcamp.com/).

As always, I'd like to thank all the little wikipedian hands that put the relevant articles together.

Let's conclude with a quote from Wally's announcement:

> I know you’re smiling up there, you pioneer of the stars.
