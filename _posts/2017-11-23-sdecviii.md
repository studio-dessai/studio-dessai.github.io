title: "Studio d'essai cviii – with Molecules to Minds"
---

The Brisbane-based instrumental post-rock band [Molecules to Minds](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/08a3f374-df3e-4d7e-915b-2f7e3cfb2cec) joined Stéphane to chat about their first album, _[Ascent Into Insignificance](https://moleculestominds.bandcamp.com/album/ascent-into-insignificance)_. There's a bit of banter about music production and distribution, Persian music, documentary soundtracks and what's next for the band.

If you live around Brisbane, make sure you catch them at [The Bearded Lady](http://www.thebeardedlady.com.au/) on the 10th of December.

Thank you so much Steve and Moe for joining us! (and Adam and Andy for making it difficult to focus.)
