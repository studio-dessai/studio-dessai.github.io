Today, we're covering eleven countries with all kinds of tracks. You can download every single one of them from different sources linked in the playlist.

Steph contacted [Magiska plantor](https://soundcloud.com/mxps), who created the track *Ärrvävnad* under the moniker "Einar Nilson". Here is what he had to say about this track:

	"I don't remember exactly how I recorded this, but most likely, as with most of the music I make, I did it an early morning almost two years ago.
	It's recorded on a 4-tracker with two layers of a borrowed Korg Monotron and probably one channel of EDP Wasp. All through some delays and distortion from the 4-tracker. It was also slightly pitched before transferring it to the computer.
	I like to have different aliases and this is probably the only track I made under this name. At the time of creating this song I was working on a made up soundtrack for a swedish sci-fi book called *Projekt Nyaga* by the writer Peter Nilson and that's also where I got the name for the "artist" on this song."

Steph also mentionned some exciting releases and re-releases available on Room40: follow [this link](http://emporium.room40.org/) to get a hold of them!

Enjoy!
