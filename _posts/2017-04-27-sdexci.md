Today, nothing too fancy. Just a random selection of music that I find special enough to play on air. Couple of freebies too, lucky bugger.

This year's edition of the [Human Rights Arts and Film Festival](http://2017.hraff.org.au/) might be coming to your city. Have a look.

Tom Fahy is the weirdest ensemble/persona/entity around, check out their [website](http://fahy.co/).
