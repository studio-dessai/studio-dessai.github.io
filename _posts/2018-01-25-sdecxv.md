Back this week healthy and all, let's take a stab at that backlog of great music: we start off with an echo from the last episode, then follow with a couple of revenants from the FMA mix, three tracks from the new incarnation of [Dave Keifer](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/9f0d44e7-cefe-4192-99ba-d9672de6eb3a), and finish with an FMA shoegaze gem and some Polish indie label collaboration goodness.

Have a lovely one!
