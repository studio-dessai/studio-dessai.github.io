First episode of a series dedicated to Netlabel Day 2016. Stéphane decided to go through all of this year's releases, so you don't have to do it yourself!

Check out the [Paradise Lottery](http://parasitelottery.com/) project, and the cool people at [Casco](https://soundcloud.com/user-30393718) too.

Dive into Jan Eerala's documented environment on his fascinating [weblog](http://www.eerala.com/weblog/).
