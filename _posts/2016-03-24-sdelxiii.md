title: "Studio d'essai lxiii"
---

A diverse selection this week, with both hectic and soothing tracks from the Philippines, Cuba, the USA, Japan, Greece, England, Germany and Switzerland.

Discovered this week, I have enjoyed listening to [MU Radio Campus Bruxelles](https://www.mixcloud.com/MU_radio_campus_bruxelles/), from Belgium. Make sure you check them out.

Thanks [Luciftias](https://diasp.org/u/luciftias) for sharing your work on Diaspora*!

Enjoy!
