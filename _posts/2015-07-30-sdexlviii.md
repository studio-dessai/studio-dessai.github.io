title: "Studio d'essai xlviii – with Erik Griswold"
---

Erik Griswold is a prolific composer-pianist specialised in prepared piano, toy piano and perussion, who now calls Brisbane home – even though he doesn't seem to be able to stay still at all. He joined Stéphane to share his playlist of tracks he released – solo or in different projects –, by artists that influenced him, or by others who are also part of the ROOM40 family.

Make sure you have a look at his comprehensive [website](http://www.erikgriswold.org/index.php), where you can listen to a few of his works and read about them too.

You can see him live in a series of very intimate concerts starting on the 14th of August 2015, for the launch of _Pain Avoidance Machine_, part of the celebrations for ROOM40's 15th anniversary. Get tickets [here](http://emporium.room40.org/concerts/12994-pain-avoidance-machine) before they run out.

Thank you very much Erik for a great show! Looking forward to another one.
