title: "Studio d'essai cxxviii â€“ Purge 2: Sun Ra"
---

I'm giving [Sun Ra](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/c27cac8e-4c4a-48c0-a4ba-41399b9c176d) the boot, because it's way too wacky for a random Sunday morning shuffle of my music library. So here is most of _The Heliocentric Worlds of Sun Ra_, volumes 1 and 2, an infinitely tiny sample of Sun Ra's outrageously prolific output.

Be good and have a rest!
