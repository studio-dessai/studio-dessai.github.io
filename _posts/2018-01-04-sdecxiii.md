title: "Studio d'essai cxiii"
---

To start the year 12018, here are luke-warm leftovers from [Damian's selection](https://studio-dessai.github.io/2017/12/14/sdecxi/), the best of _[Balkan Under the Radar vol. 5: Under the Black Flag](http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Balkan_Under_The_Radar_vol_5/Under_The_Black_Flag_1654/)_ according to moi, and some other randomly discovered artists.

In this show, we cover various genres including experimental folk, noise, house, ambient and IDM, as well as seven different countries.

Enjoy! And may this year make you feel happy, valid, safe and at peace.
