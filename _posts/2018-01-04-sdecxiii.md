title: "Studio d'essai cxiii"
---

To start the year 12018, here are luke-warm leftovers from [Damian's selection](https://studio-dessai.github.io/2017/12/14/sdecxi/), the best of _[Balkan Under the Radar vol. 5: Under the Black Flag](http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Balkan_Under_The_Radar_vol_5/Under_The_Black_Flag_1654/)_ according to moi, and some other randomly discovered artists.

In this show, we cover various genres including experimental folk, noise, house, ambient and IDM, as well as seven different countries.

Enjoy! And may this year make you feel happy, valid, safe and at peace.

Edit: 4EB's automatic stream does not seem to have been logged, so here is an audio file that should work:

  Your browser doesn't seem to be able to play embedded m4a audio.
