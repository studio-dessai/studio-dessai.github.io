_I got to the studio late because of an injured possum – the possum is fine – so skip to 7:30 for the actual start of the show (although you might just enjoy the first few minutes of ambient music that are from [this older show](https://studio-dessai.github.io/2017/12/28/sdecxii/)_

Four tracks but six places, spanning 45 years.
