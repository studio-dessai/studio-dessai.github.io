title: "Studio d'essai xxxvi – David Lynch"
---

As the [Brisbane Gallery of Modern Art](http://www.qagoma.qld.gov.au/) is putting on an amazing show about the David Lynch universe, _[Between Two Worlds](http://www.qagoma.qld.gov.au/exhibitions/current/davidlynch?refer=homepageFEATURElynch)_, we decided to dedicate this episode to his music, his soundtracks and the importance of sound in his work.

We had the largest crow so far in the studio, with David, Tim, Dave, Lochlan and Stéphane. Excuse the few hiccups at the beginning of the show!

Enjoy!
