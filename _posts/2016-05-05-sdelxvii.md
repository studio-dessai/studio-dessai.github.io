title: "Studio d'essai lxvii – Alsace #1"
---

67 is the number for Bas-Rhin, the French "departement" Steph is from. So this episode is all about music from or inspired by Bas-Rhin, or the Alsace region in general!

Some of the sountrack of the documentary [Strasbourg Est](https://vimeo.com/19338759) (1988, by Alain Willaume et Georges Pasquier) features during the show. It is a great testimony that gives an idea of what the guts of the city felt like in the late eighties. But don't let it influence your decision to visit that beautiful place – it is not as bleak as this doco paints it!

To explore a bit more of the music, listen this -RBDP- live set at [Sharivari](https://soundcloud.com/rbdp/live-set-sharivari-139) or find a wealth of CC music on [Ayankoko's blog](http://ayankoko.blogspot.com.au/).
