---

Indie Rock Mag, an online music magazine, put together an enormous compilation of amazing music to celebrate the new season of Twin Peaks. We listen to Stéphane's favourite tracks from the three parts that were first released: I, II and VI. We'll make sure we go through the rest of it in future episodes.

Next week, we'll be talking post-rock with the Brisbane band [Molecules to Mind](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/08a3f374-df3e-4d7e-915b-2f7e3cfb2cec).

Enjoy, and be well.
