title: "Studio d'essai ci â€“ On the Air: Women in Experimental Music"
---

My favourite tracks from the massive compilation of works from the 2013 edition of the MuseRuole festival. Only music from female experimental musicians from around the world. Find out more on their [Tumblr](http://museruole2013.tumblr.com/about) and get the whole CC-By-NC-ND compilation on the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/ontheair_jukebox) (got a spare 1.8 GB?).

You can find the direct links to each file in the playlist below; they also point to fascinating information about each track and each artist, which I haven't been able to read on air because of lack of time.
