title: "Studio d'essai cxxiv â€“ Netlabel Day 2017 #7: long ones"
---

The final episode in the NLD2017 series only has three tracks, but closes the series with a representative sample of what is often played on studio d'essai: experimentations with noise, ambient soundscapes, layered lingering loops and field recording.

Thank you to all the netlabels and artists featured here! And looking forward to this year's edition.

Take care!
