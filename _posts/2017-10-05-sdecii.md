Two tracks from the Americas tonight, one released this year, the other about thirteen years ago. Both tracks from the Commons.

Erratum: Luciftias doesn't necessary use Linux, given that Ardour can be used on Windows and MacOS. But I still suspect he might be a bit of a Free Software enthusiast somehow... Oh hang on, Guitarix is mostly for Linux. Surely he didn't build it of MacOS. I think I was right to assume.
