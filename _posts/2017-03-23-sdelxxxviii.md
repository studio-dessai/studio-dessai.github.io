title: "Studio d'essai lxxxviii – francophonie expérimentale #2"
---

Long time no see! Turns out having a baby is tiring!

This is the second episode exploring some experimental music from the Francophonie. Today we hang out in the seventies, and next time we'll linger there a bit more.

I should have mentioned that Dashiell Heddayat's song involves the great psychedelic prog rock Franco-international band [Gong](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/5927990e-34bb-493f-b5da-b7b28d43698f) backing him up.
