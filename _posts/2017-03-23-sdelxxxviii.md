title: "Studio d'essai lxxxviii – francophonie expérimentale #2"
---

Long time no see! Turns out having a baby is tiring!

This is the second episode exploring some experimental music from the Francophonie. Today we hang out in the late sixties and early seventies, and next time we'll linger in the seventies a bit more.

I should have mentioned that Dashiell Hedayat's song involves the great psychedelic prog rock Franco-international band [Gong](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/5927990e-34bb-493f-b5da-b7b28d43698f) backing him up.
