title: "Studio d'essai lxviii â€“ Alsace #2"
---

Second show on Alsace, or Grand Est, or whatever it will be called officially later this year. Find the tracks and links below.

Throughout the show, you also heard a big chunk of the two hour-long 1981 [presentation](https://soundcloud.com/club-44/w-1145-mp3) that [Les Percussions de Strasbourg](http://musicbrainz.org/artist/6c0b5a0d-8919-46eb-8610-1b8f6a3cd7b8) gave at the Club 44, and some field recording from Toulouse by Claire Sauvaget, which you can download on the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/aporee_21853_25396).

You can explore more of [William Nurdin](http://musicbrainz.org/artist/5b1ca1f6-5252-4621-98bb-3e673e62f1e4)'s destructive art on [his website](http://nwwn.tk/), and watch [this cool video](https://vimeo.com/83684166) to get an idea of what FAAAL looks like live.
