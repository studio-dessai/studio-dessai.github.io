title: "Studio d'essai lxiv â€“ Death Grips"
---

Tim prepared a playlist of his favourite Death Grips tracks, to explore the diversity of this project's short and intense (resuscitated) history, and to discuss their industrial/experimental/punk aesthetics.

Tim also recommends to listen to some other tracks from _[The Money Store](http://musicbrainz.org/release-group/aa0b4e86-358e-4c92-aecd-94f5f59233f7)_ that we did not manage to play during the show: Blackjack, Double Helix, Fever (Aye Aye). Also make sure you have a listen to [Elevator Grips](https://elevatorgrips.bandcamp.com/releases) for a laugh!
