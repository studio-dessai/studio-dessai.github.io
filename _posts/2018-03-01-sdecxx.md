For the third NLD2017 episode, we are starting in Northern Europe, then going to North America, heading down to South America and finishing back in Northern Europe, with music mostly from [Cajanegra](https://musicbrainz.org/label/583c1b40-6528-483f-9a23-6c216deba31f) and [MarsMelons](https://musicbrainz.org/label/90cd79c5-7799-4742-97c5-fb4c4e375e81).

Share the music you like widely, and remember to support these artists if you want them to keep working for the Commons!

We hope you have a beautiful one.
