title: "Studio d'essai cxxxii â€“ Drone Day 2018 #1"
---

Drone Day 2018 happened on the 26th of May. I discovered it existed because of Ablaut & co's release. Here, we play a diverse selection spanning _42_ years.

I've got too many drone tracks to play, so there will be a second episode dedicated to the event!

Make sure you check out [_Wires for Empathy_'s beautiful trailer](http://wiresforempathy.org/) and support its production if you have the means and the will!

Be good.
